You are given a list of control panel elements. This includes all the executable parts (e.g. buttons, dials, bars, switches). If the given control panel element is not clear about whether it is a button, dial, bar, switch, please check the user manual and add its type behind it. For example, if a given element is named "2h" and you feel it is an button after you read the user manual, then rename the element as a "2h_button". Please only include alphabets, numbers and underscores in the name and do not include any other symbols or special characters.

Based on the given template below, please create necessary actions based on the actions described in the user manual and the list of visually grounded interactive control panel elements. 

You can construct the following types of high-level actions: press a button, press a knob, press a dial, press_and_hold a button for a duration, press_and_hold_button1_and_button2 for a duration, turn a dial in clockwise or anticlockwise direction. Note that you can only turn a dial, you can not turn a button. 

For example, if a “kitchen_timer_button” and a "time_dial" can be pressed, then the actions can be constructed as below. 

press_kitchen_timer_button
press_time_dial

Another example, if activating the child lock requires pressing "start_button" for 5 seconds, then a method can be: press_and_hold_stop_button. Please do not include the exact duration in the action name, but write it beside as a comment: press_and_hold_stop_button (duration = 5 seconds). If the duration is not specified clearly, then write as 3 seconds.

If an action requires button1 and button2 to be pressed simulataneously for 3 seconds, such as press start button and cancel button, then a method can be called press_and_hold_start_button_and_cancel_button. Do not include the duration in the action name, but write it beside as a comment: press_and_hold_start_button_and_cancel_button (duration = 3 seconds)

List all the available actions. Please do not miss the press_dial and press_and_hold_button actions if they are mentioned. The format is similar to "press_kitchen_timer_button". Please ensure the action includes the control element type, such as "button", "dial", or "digital display". If an action regarding a control panel elements is not applicable in any task or are duplicate, do not include it. Do not include anything else, just list all the actions, each action in a seperate line. For example, if you notice there are 3 actions being mentioned, namely action_1, action_2, action_3, then return them as:

action_1 
action_2 
action_3
