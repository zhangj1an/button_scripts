I have a simulator of an electrical appliance. The code is as follows:

xxxxx 

The current model state is as below. This is based on my proposition and is not necessarily the ground truth of the actual appliance in the real world. The model state format should be consistent with the __str__ function of the Python object.

yyyyy


Now, I want to apply an action to the appliance. The action is as follows: 

zzzzz 

Note that if the action is "end", this means no actions should be applied. The model state should remain the same.

After I apply the action, the current digital display is as below, which may reflect a parameter value I am adjusting. The action may or may not successfully adjust the value in the way I wanted. 

wwwww 

The world model is not an accurate reflection of the appliance, so the actual variable state should follow the value displayed by the digital display feedback. For example, suppose your modelled variable has options [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, the display shows "6". Then your inferred variable state shoudl be 6.

Now, please output the current model state based on the original code, applied action, and observed digital display response. If anything is not clear, you can refer to the user manual too. The model state format should be consistent with the __str__ function of the Python object. Please just output the model state without any explanation.
