Attached is the user manual of an appliance and a photo of the control panel. Please examine the image and list all the control panel elements listed by the user manual and is visible in the image. This includes all the executable parts (e.g. buttons, dials, bars, switches). Please only include interactive component that a human can use to change the machine state, not static text labels or symbols. If a control panel element is depicted in the graphical control panel and is implicitly mentioned as being used individually for a unique feature, include it in the list. This applies even if the element is not explicitly named in the text but is necessary for operating specific functions.

Please go through the entire document and do not miss any thing. Do not mention things that are not part of the control panel. The naming convention is the control element name followed by type connected by underscore, such as "cook_button".

Please ensure the control panel element name matches with the name given by the user manual. For example, if the user manual says a button is named "start/stop", list the button as start_stop_button, not two buttons, start_button and stop_button. 

Please cross-reference the image to verify if multiple names refer to the same physical control element. If they do, list it as a single element with combined functionality. For example, if a dial is used for both power level and timer, list the dial as a single "power_level_timer_dial". If a digital display can be used to display both menu and time, list the display as a single "digital_display". Furthermore, only list down the name of the control panel element entity, and ignore its label markings. For example, a single power dial can have multiple labels like "low", "medium", "high". In this case, list the dial as a single "power_level_dial" and ignore the labels. Do not use the text or labels shown in the image to name control panel elements. For example, a menu button is named "function_button" in the user manual, and can be used to set menu to menu_1, menu_2, menu_3. In the image, the button name is not written, only the three settings are printed as labels. Then you should write down "function_button" as its proper name, instead of naming the single button as three buttons (menu_1_button, menu_2_button, menu_3_button).

You can cross reference the given image to see if a mentioned setting/feature is managed by several seperate elements or one single element. If it is managed by several elements, Please list each element as a seperate bullet point, do not group them together. For example, if there are 9 different number pads, as indicated by the user manual and illustrated in the image, do not group them as one item like (0-9), but list out one by one: number_0_button, number_1_button, number_2_button, etc. The situation is the same for alphabet buttons. In case there are menu buttons, such as air roast, air fry, defrost, etc, try not to group them in one line too. As long as in later part of the text, the buttons appeared to be used in seperation, then do not list them in one line, but instead list each seperate button as a line. 

Please ensure to include the control panel element type in the name. For example, if the user manual says a button is named "start/stop", list the button as start_stop button, not just start_stop. Allowed panel element types include button, dial and digital_display. Other types are not allowed, including symbols, light indicators, and so on. Please ensure only lower case alphabet and number and underscore is in the element name and nothing else. The entire name should not have space in between. For example, the name "menu button" is invalid, but the name "menu_button" is valid. Please only return this list and nothing else.

Please use a Python list called names_list to list all the unique element names in the format of strings and each name in a new line. Beside each name, use Python comment to briefly describe its functions, as well as its position on the control panel. For example, suppose you have button_1, button_2 and button_3, then you can return:

names_list = [
    "button_1", # used for feature 1 and feature 2, located at the left most, with a symbol icon of ...
    "button_2", # used for feature 3, located in the middle, with a label of ...
    "button_3", # used for feature 4, located in the rightmost postiion on the panel, with a label of ...
]

Do not change the spelling of the given names. Do not add any formats like adding dash, asterisk or numbering infront of the text, just the names themselves would be enough. Do not return anything else.
