We built an internal model to reason about appliance execution. The user command is as follows: 

yyyyy

In our model, we want to make the machine to achieve the following goal state: 

wwwww

The past feedbacks we received from the real world is as follows.

hhhhh 

In the feedback string, please look for the variable that starts with "variable_" and is closest in meaning to compare with the goal state. The exact spelling of the variable name does not have to be the same. This is because for the sake of convenience, we let digital display to list the internal variable name together with the value, which may not necessarily exactly match user's modelling of variable names. For example, if the goal string variable is called variable_on_off, but the given feedback has a variable called variable_power, then these two names are referring to the same variable. If you are not sure, you can look for the variables that have the same value type, or similar semantic values. Please list the variable name from the feedback you have identified, and its value. Do not return anything else.
