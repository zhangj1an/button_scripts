We built an internal model to reason about appliance execution. The model code is as follows: 

xxxxx

The user command is as follows: 

yyyyy

In our model, we want to make the machine to achieve the following goal state: 

wwwww

The past feedbacks we received from the real world is as follows. The feedback format is variable name: variable value. So you should compare the goal value.

hhhhh 

Compare the goal state and the given feedback. 

Comparison Rules:
1. The variable names are already verified to represent the same item, so you should only compare the values.
   For example:
   - If the feedback shows `variable_power` is "On" and the goal state requires `variable_on_off` to be "On," return "Yes."
   - If the feedback shows `variable_start_pause` is "Start" and the goal state requires `variable_start_running` to be "start," return "Yes."
   - If the feedback shows `variable_mode` is "Off" and the goal state requires `variable_power` to be "On," return "No."
2. If the values differ only in capitalization or textual formatting, consider them semantically the same and return "Yes."
3. If the values contain digits, and the digits are numerically equivalent (e.g., "0g" and "0", "100cm" and "100"), consider them numerically the same and return "Yes."

Now compare the goal state and the given feedback. If they fit any of the rule above, reply "Yes." Otherwise, reply "No." Then provide a short reason. Do not return anything else.
