Here is the previous version of our modelled appliance.

xxxxx 

However, we realised definition of the following variable name is wrong.

yyyyy

We updated it to be the following:

zzzzz 

If the problematic variable's value is being processed by input strings, and the updated version did not change the variable definition, then you should just modify the relevant sections in process_input_string() and get_original_input() so that our modelling matches the format shown in the appliance.

For other updated variables, the Simulator() and ExtendedSimulator() function might contain invalid value assignment towards this variable in various actions. Can you correct them to valid value assignments and return the code for Simulator() and ExtendedSimulator() again? Do not modify other parts, just modify Simulator() and ExtendedSimulator() object codes involving that variable. Do not modify their reset() functions, directly copy them in your response. Only return Python code starting from Simulator(), and all the way till ExtendedSimulator(). If there are updated_feature_list, include it in your response too. For code given before Simulator(), such as some variable definitions and initiations, and feature_list, do not include them, as these contents will be provided.
