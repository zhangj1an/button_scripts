Here is the user manual of the appliance. 

xxxxx 

We want to model the appliance's features, and here is the instructions to construct such models. Here is the instructions to construct such models. 

yyyyy 

Here is the code library you can directly use.

zzzzz 

Here is our generated code. 

wwwww

We have an user command as follows:

hhhhh 

Using the given code, please firstly list a sequence of features needed to achieve this command, then generate the goal variable values. Here we give an example. 

Suppose following the description of the user manual, a microwave has the following code to model its functions:

variable_time = DiscreteVariable(value_range=["0", "5", "10"], current_value ="0")
variable_start = DiscreteVariable(value_range=["on", "off"], current_value ="off")

feature_list = {
	"adjust_cooking_time": {
		{"step": 1, "actions": ["turn_time_dial_clockwise", "turn_time_dial_anticlockwise"], "variable": "variable_time"}
	},
	"start_cooking": {
		{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button", "press_cancel_button"], "variable": "variable_start"}
	}
}

(here we omit the Simulator Class code for brevity, but suppose it is complete)

Then, suppose user command is to set the microwave cooking time to 5 minutes and then start cooking. Then the sequence of features needed is: "adjust_cooking_time" and "start_cooking. The goal variable values is: set variable_time to "5", set variable_start to "on". 

For our user command, please firstly write in Python comment, the set of features and goal variable values to achieve this command. Do you think the given code correctly models the appliance features that can be used to achieve this command? If yes, return the following:

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator): 
	pass

If no, please firstly write as Python comment, whether the code missed out any appliance features described in the user manual, and quote the relavent user manual text that describes the missing features. Note that you should only model features involving operating control panel of the appliance (i.e. actions involving dial turning and button pressing). Other actions should not be modelled. Examples of such invalid actions includes flip open lids, place items in container, pull open doors, pour water into container, etc. When you create new features, you should strictly follow the instructions given above, do not hallucinate feature steps not specified by the user manual.

Then please generate Python code to create an ExtendedSimulator(Simulator), and create new variables, features or modify some of its action effects so that it now includes the required features. Note that the new feature should have different content against existing features. If a feature step is required to achieve the task, you must include it. Otherwise please omit this feature step. Please check all actions that are mentioned in the new feature and modify its action effect if applicable. 

If meta_actions_on_numbers / alphabets are involved in your newly created features, please modify the relevant section in process_input_string() or press_number_button(). If you added new conditions in press_number_button() or process_input_string() to convert number inputs to variable values, you need to create this condition in get_original_input() to convert variable values back to number inputs. This is because we need to rely on get_original_input() to decide on the sequence of actions to take to achieve this target value. 

For example, suppose in press_number_button(), in feature_a and variable_x, all the input digits w will set variable_x to a value of "w cups". Then you need to in get_original_input(), create a condition of (feature_a, variable_x), and convert the variable value of "w cups" back to "w". 

For each (feature, variable_name) tuple, write in a separate condition.

For example, 

variable_additional = … (a new variable )
updated_feature_list = feature_list 
updated_feature_list[“a_new_feature”] = [
	{“step”: 1, “action”: ["action_a", "action_b", "action_c", ...], “variable”: “variable_additional”}
]

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator): 
	def reset(self):
		super().reset()
		self.feature = Feature(feature_list=updated_feature_list, current_value=("empty", 1)) 
		self.variable_additional = variable_additional 

	def action_a(self):
		self.feature.update_progress(“action_a”)
		current_feature = self.feature.current_value[0]
		if current_feature == “a_new_feature”:
			self.variable_additional.set_current_value(“a_certain_value”)

Note that when modifying process_input_string() and get_original_input(), you just need to write the new condition. For the rest conditions, you can use super.process_input_string() and super.get_original_input().
