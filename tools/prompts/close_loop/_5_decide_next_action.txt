You are tasked to operate an appliance. The user command is as follows:

xxxxx 

The relevant user manual text is as follows: 

yyyyy 

The list of actions you can take is as follows:

zzzzz 

The way for you to give an valid action is to return a Python variable: next_action = ("action_name", execution_times, action_duration)

If the action involvs pressing a button or turning a dial, the action duration is 0. If the action involves press and hold one or two buttons, the action duration is the number of seconds to press and hold it. For example, suppose you have the following actions to choose from: press_button_a, press_and_hold_button_b, press_dial_c. Depending on the situation, you decide the next action to take is: press_button_a for 5 times. Then you should return:

next_action = ("press_button_a", 5, 0)

Note that the action name is string, execution times and action duration is integer.

Here is the record of your past executions on the machine and the returned feedback.

Please return the next action to take in Python. Do not return anything else.
