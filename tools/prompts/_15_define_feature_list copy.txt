Below is the code template of the Feature() class that is helpful for modelling appliance features:

hhhhh

The user manual of an appliance describes all the features of an appliance. Each feature contains a step-by-step instruction to achieve a particular task. The criteria for successfully achieving a task is to set the related variables to their target values. Variables can be adjusted by executing some actions. Based on the user manual, list of available actions and list of variables of the appliance, please list all the features of the appliance. 

############################# 
### format of a feature ### 
#############################

Suppose the user manual describes a feature like this:

"""
**1. Clock Setting**
1) Press " CLOCK " once, the hour figure flash;
2) Press "up arrow" or "down arrow" to adjust the hour figures, the input time should be within 0--23.
3) Press " CLOCK ", the minute figures will flash.
4) Turn "up arrow" or "down arrow" to adjust the minute figures, the input time should be within 0--59.
5) Press " CLOCK " to finish clock setting. ":" will flash, the "clock symbol" indicator will go out. The clock setting has been finished.
"""

We are given a list of available actions for this microwave: 
press_up_arrow_button, press_down_arrow_button, press_clock_button, 

We are also given a list of available variables for this microwave: 
variable_clock_setting_hour, variable_clock_setting_minute

We will create a feature_list to include this feature. In this example, the created feature_list will look like this:

feature_list = {}
feature_list["clock_setting"] = [
        {"step": 1,”actions”: ["press_clock_button"]}, 
        {"step": 2,”actions": [“press_up_arrow_button", "press_down_arrow_button"], "variable": "variable_clock_setting_hour"}, 
        {"step": 3, "actions": ["press_clock_button"]}, 
        {"step": 4, "actions": ["press_up_arrow_button", "press_down_arrow_button"], "variable": "variable_clock_setting_minute"}, 
        {"step": 5, "actions": ["press_clock_button”]}]

Remeber to include actions with similar function into the same step. For example, suppose variable_x can be set to "x1" by action_x1, and set to "x2" by action_x2. Then write the feature as feature_list["set_var_x"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["action_x1", "action_x2"], "variable": "variable_x"}].

We will now explain the format of the feature list. The feature list is a dictionary. Each feature is a dictionary item. This dictionary item contains the step-by-step procedure as a list, and contains methods to adjust all the variables required to complete a task. Each list includes a sequence of steps, each step is a dictionary. Each step can only describe one and only one of the capabilities below. If a user manual sentence contains multiple capabilities below, you need to break it down into several steps. 

1. Activation of starting to set a variable value. 
2. Setting a variable value.
3. Confirmation of finish setting a variable value.

Each step contains three parts: step index, the list of actions that can be executed in this step, and the only variable that can be adjusted by these actions. The variable naming convention is variable_{functionality_name}_{variable_name}, such as “variable_{clock_setting}_{hour}”. The variables and actions can only be selected from the ones given. Only use actions and variables if they are explicitly described in the user manual. Please go through the variable and action list to ensure all the items explicitly described by the user manual are mentioned in the feature list. 

Ignore this paragraph if there is no variables called "variable_input_string". Note that input strings should not be included in the feature list. If there are any input strings, you can add a comment in the feature list beside its corresponding variable saying that the variable should be parsed from this input string. 

This feature list will be processed by the Feature() class in the code template above. Please include the following line in your script: 

simulator_feature = Feature(feature_list=feature_list, current_value=("empty", 1))

After initiating the Feature() object, a specific step in the feature list can be accessed via a tuple (feature_name, step), such as (“clock_setting”, 3). Given the current feature and the new incoming action, Feature() can check whether this action will update the progress to the next step or switch the feature to another one by calling the update_progress(action). If there are special cases regarding functionality, you can inherit the Feature() object and create your custom function. Remember to change the "simulator_feature" code accordingly. The code for Feature() itself and the list of actions and variables are fully provided in the library, so please do not include them in your response to save space. Just output the code, no need explanation or import statements. 


######################################
### Conditions to create a feature ### 
######################################

Please only model the features that is relevant to this type of appliances (e.g. cooking features is relevant for a pressure cooker). If a feature describes complex features, then do not model this feature. Examples include but not limited to: wifi connection, external app controls, remote controller functions, reset, clean or replace of physical parts like aircon filters or coffee bean hopper, feedback from indicator lights or touchscreens, press and hold buttons to quickly switch values, multi-stage operation, memory function, sound/audio related configurations, query or adjust variables after the machine has started operation. 

If a feature is only mentioned when introducing buttons, switches or dials, but that description is not complete enough to constitute a feature in its own, then do not create it. For example, when introducing a dial as a “timer” dial, and the description says, “the dial can be pressed to adjust cooking time”, without mentioning the detail in step-wise instructions, then ignore this feature. Only when the feature is explained in the user manual clearly with step-wise instructions, then model it. 

Usually the use manual will have a section or paragraph dedicated to each feature, then a feature list can be created for that feature. However, if for the same section, multiple variables are explained, and setting any of these variables is irrelevant to setting other variables, then they should be split into several different features. For example, suppose in the same section, the explanation says action_a can be used to adjust variable_a, and action_b can be used to adjust variable_b, but these two variables does not work towards the same goal. Let's say one is to set child lock, another is to replace faulty filters. Or one is to set cooking time when the cooking process have not started, but another is to set cooking time when the appliance already started cooking These two variables are used in different contexts. Then the feature_list code should be:

feature_list["adjust_var_a] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["action_a"], "variable": "variable_a"}]
feature_list["adjust_var_b] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["action_b"], "variable": "variable_b"}]

Otherwise, try to model the feature as a whole. For example, suppose for a microwave, both cooking time and cooking power needs to be set to start cooking, then you can create features like this: 

feature_list["cooking"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["action_a", "action_b"], "variable": "variable_cooking_time"},
        {"step": 2, "actions": ["action_c", "action_d"], "variable": "variable_cooking_power"}]

There are some actions that can be applied in any context. For example, the start, power_on_off, cancel button can be pressed anytime. You can create a seperate feature for each too. If these buttons exists, you can create features like this:
feature_list["start_function"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button"], "variable": "variable_start"}]
feature_list["turn_on_off"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_on_button", "press_cancel_button"], "variable": "variable_on_off"}]

Sometimes, a feature might also describe two different ways to set the same variable. Then you should split the feature into two seperate methods so the procedure is clearer. For example, suppose a variable_time can be set both by pressing "+" "-" button or by pressing number pads. Then the feature_list code should be: 

feature_list["adjust_variable_time_using_plus_minus"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_time"}]
feature_list["adjust_variable_time_using_number"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": meta_actions_on_numbers, "variable": "variable_time"}]

Please check the user manual carefully and make sure that all features are modelled. Only exclude the aforementioned features that are too complicated.

#############################################
### Modelling rules to avoid ambiguity ### 
#############################################

Note that any two features cannot start with the same action. If the two steps serve the same purpose, please remove the action from one of the features. For example, suppose both "popcorn" and "grill" button can be used to set microwave cooking mode. But for grill, we still need to model its grill time duration. Then, if we model like this:

feature_list["adjust_mode"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_popcorn_button", "press_grill_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"}
]

feature_list["grill"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_grill_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"}
        {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_grill_time"}
]

Then the two features will both have "grill" as the starting action, which is confusing. Instead, we can model the features like this:

feature_list["adjust_mode"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_popcorn_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"}
]

feature_list["grill"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_grill_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"}
        {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_grill_time"}
]

Then when we press each action, we are clear about the feature it is dealing with and there is no ambiguity. 

If the same action is used for adjusting different variables, we should add conditions before these two variables to be clear about its prerequisites. For example, suppose in popcorn mode, we can adjust cooking weight, but in grill mode, we can adjust cooking time. Then if we model like this:

feature_list["adjust_mode"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_popcorn_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"}
]

feature_list["adjust_popcorn_setting"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_popcorn_weight"}
]

feature_list["adjust_grill_setting"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_grill_time"}
]

Let me give another example. Suppose when we press plus or minus button, it is confusing which feature we are adjusting. Instead, we can model like this:

feature_list["grill"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_grill_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"} # the grill button can adjust menu 
        {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_grill_time"} # the plus and minus button can adjust grill time 
]

feature_list["popcorn"] = [
        {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_popcorn_button"], "variable": "variable_mode"} # the popcorn button can adjust menu 
        {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_popcorn_weight"} # the plus and minus button can adjust popcorn weight
]

Then, it would be very clear what variable we are adjusting when we press plus and minus buttons. Please do not miss out variables in each step, double check whether the action is capable of adjusting any variable. 


#############################################
### Modelling more advanced features ### 
#############################################

If two consecutive steps in a feature is modifying the same variable, they should be merged into the same step. For example, if both “lock” and “unlock” action are modifying the variable_child_lock and are in consecutive steps in a feature, these two actions should appear in the same step. 

Sometimes in a step, one single action (e.g. press a button) will affect more than one variable. For example, on a microwave, pressing a "start" button can both start the cooking process and add the cooking time by 30 seconds. Pressing a "popcorn" button will both set the menu_index to "popcorn", and adjust "popcorn cooking weight" to the next value. If all these variables will be assigned to their next value in the value range, do not model this feature because it is too complicated. If only one variable will be assigned to its next value in the value range, and the rest of the variables will be set to a fixed value, like our "start" example, then you can model it. In the feature list, only include the variable that will have its value assigned dynamically. In our example, you should include the cooking time variable, as it will keep increase by 30 seconds. The start cooking variable will always be set to "start". For the variables that will have its value assigned to a fixed value, write them as a "comment" attribute in that step, include the variable name and the target value. This will be helpful when we implement the action effects of the appliance later. For example, if pressing an button A will change variable B to a fixed value b, variable C to a fixed value c and variable D to its next value in the value range, then you should write "comment": "variable A: set to a, variable B: set to b” in the comments, and write variable D in the feature list. In the popcorn example, you should write "popcorn cooking weight" in the "variable" attribute, and write "menu_index" needs to be set to popcorn in comments. 
 
In case you encounter number buttons or alphabet buttons, you should always make the feature list more compact by creating additional meta-actions that includes a fixed group of actions, then include meta-actions in the feature list. For example, one meta-action can be meta_actions_on_number = ["press_number_1_button", "press_number_2_button", "press_number_3_button", "press_number_4_button", "press_number_5_button", "press_number_6_button", "press_number_7_button", "press_number_8_button", "press_number_9_button", "press_number_0_button"]. Then in the feature_list, instead of listing all the 10 actions, you should just write meta_actions_on_number. The naming convention is “meta_actions_on” followed by the name of the groups of actions. You should always create either meta_actions_on_number or meta_actions_on_alphabet for numbers and alphabets to make the feature_list more concise. Here we provide meta_actions_on_number in the code template and you can directly quote them, and you can create your own meta_actions variable.

These number buttons and alphabet buttons would have an action effect of adding a string character on a existing variable. For example, press_number_1_button, then press_number_3_button can make the timer to change from 0 minutes to 13 minutes. Please create a variable called meta_actions_dict to store these action effects. The key is the intended string character that one wants to add and the item is the corresponding action that can cause this effect. In our example, it will be: 

meta_actions_dict = {
        "1": "press_number_1_button",
        "3": "press_number_3_button",
}

For every action in the meta-actions list, please create a corresponding entry in the meta_actions_dict. Our sample meta_actions_dict includes the mapping of number related actions, but you need to create your own dict if new mappings are involved.

If the variable input string needs to be utilised to parse the input of numbers or alphabets, please add a python comment beside that feature step in the feature list. This will be a useful reminder when we implement the action effect of the appliance later. The variable_input_string can not be a valid "variable" value. For example, 

feature_list["clock"] =  [
        {"step": 1,"actions": ["a"]},
        {"step": 2,"actions": meta_actions_on_numbers, "variable": "variable_clock", } # requires parsting from variable_input_string
        {"step": 3,"actions": ["a"]} ]

However, if a variable does not require nunmber pads or alphabets to adjust, please just model the required actions, and do not mention meta_actions. 

Among the given available actions that is not used in any features, include it in the "null" feature. For example,  suppose action "a", "b", "c" is not used in any feature. Then in the feature of feature_list["null"] =  [{"step": 1,”actions”: ["a", "b", "c"]}]. If all actions have been included, do not create the "null" key.
