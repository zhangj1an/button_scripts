Can you generate everyday commands that a human may instruct an intelligent robot to reasonably execute a household appliance? Asssume the human has no knowledge about the specific instance, brand, modelling, and features of the appliance but just know its machine type. The command should be clear in the semantic sense, for example, ask the robot to execute a microwave and "heat up a bottle of milk". The command should be able to succefully executed by a human if instructed to so. The command should each have some conditionings, such it requires some commonsense to think about the ideal parameters. For example, the milk can have a certain weight, or has a target temperature, or particular target audience. 

Please do not generate tasks that uses complex features like WiFi connection, multi-stage usage, memory, filter reset, sense air quality, and such. Keep the task short and doable.

As a robot, to operate the appliance, you have carefully read the user manual of the appliance and a simulator written in python code that includes all the features a robot can reasonably accompilsh. Please generate commands that can be specifically accomplished by this Python simulator, representing this appliance. 

Suppose the appliance is of type xxxxx. Please give 10 different everyday commands. The user manual and the Python code is attached below. Please ensure the commands are expressed in natural language and no code appears. Ensure the target variable settings are all specified clearly.
