Based on the user command regarding operation of an appliance, and the relevant user manual context of the appliance, generate the goal state that is conceptually equivalent to the user command. The goal state should be in the format of the world model. For variables that are relevant to the task, indicate the value clearly. For variables that can be set to any value, indicate "any".

For example, suppose the user instruction is to power on a microwave. Suppose the user manual says, to set power on, we need to press the "POWER" button. Then suppose the microwave has a world model with the following variables:

power_on_or_off, cooking_time, cooking_temperature.

Then the goal state should be:
power_on_or_off: ON 
cooking_time: any 
cooking_temperature: any 

For our current task, the user command is: 

xxxxx 

The relevant user manual context of the appliance is: 

yyyyy 

Please write the goal state in the format of a list of "variable name: variable values". Be brief but do not miss out variables. Thanks!
