Attached is the photo and user manual of an appliance.

Here is the proposed list of all the control panel elements described by the user manual. This includes all the executable parts (e.g. buttons, dials, bars, switches).

yyyyy

However, these elements might be redundant, namely, the same physical element might be given two different names. For example, a menu button might be able to adjust the setting to menu_1, menu_2, and menu_3. Then instead of listing menu_1_button, menu_2_button, and menu_3_button respectively, listing menu_button would be enough. Another example, a feature_x is enabled by pressing button_1 and button_2 together, but there is no physical dial_x or button_x that can be directly used to activate feature_x, then instead of listing dial_x or button_x, it would be enough to list button_1 and button_2. Please carefuly check every single listed element name against the image. If the element being referred to on the image is already being named as a previous element, then consider merging these two names into a single name according to the user manual. 

Please use a Python list called names_list to list all the unique element names in the format of strings and each name in a new line. Beside each name, use Python comment to briefly describe its functions. For example, suppose you have button_1, button_2 and button_3, then you can return:

names_list = [
    "button_1", # used for feature 1 and feature 2
    "button_2", # used for feature 3
    "button_3", # used for feature 4 
]

Do not change the spelling of the given names. Do not add any formats like adding dash, asterisk or numbering infront of the text, just the names themselves would be enough. Do not return anything else.
