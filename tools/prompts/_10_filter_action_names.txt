Here is a list of proposed actions of the appliance. 

xxxxx

Here is a list of control panel elements. This includes all the executable parts (e.g. buttons, dials, bars, switches). 

zzzzz

Please filter each action so that you only return a list of unique actions, each has its action effects decribed by the user manual below. After the action name, use a Python comment to write down the action type ("press", "press and hold" or "turn") and the control panel element name. If both the action type and the button name are the same, these two actions are identical. 

Here is the user manual content.
 
yyyyy

For example, I have a list of actions: 

action_1
action_2 
action_3 
action_4

Upon reading the user manual, I realise that action_3 is not mentioned anywhere in the user manual. Furthermore, action_4 and action_2 are identical actions, because they are acting on the same button and has the same action effect. Then I return:

action_list = [
action_1,  # action_type: type_1, button_name: button_1
action_2,  # action_type: type_2, button_name: button_2
]

Please only return this python variable action_list and do not return anything else as I have to directly execute this content.
