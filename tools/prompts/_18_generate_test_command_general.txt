Can you generate everyday commands that a human may instruct an intelligent robot to reasonably execute a household appliance? Asssume the human has no knowledge about the specific instance, brand, modelling, and features of the appliance but just know its machine type. The command should be clear in the semantic sense, for example, ask the robot to execute a microwave and "heat up a bottle of milk". The command should be able to succefully executed by a human if instructed to so. The command should each have some conditionings, such it requires some commonsense to think about the ideal parameters. For example, the milk can have a certain weight, or has a target temperature, or particular target audience.

Suppose the appliance is of type xxxxx. 

We want to let a robot to execute the commands on 5 different appliances. For each appliance, we have the user manual and its simulator code. Please try your best to generate commands that can be achieved in all or most of the appliances' Python simulator, and propose specific target states as much as possible. This is so that we can have a reasonable evaluation metric of whether the command can be satisfactorily executed on the appliance by a robot.

For example, if all of the given rice cooker examples is able to cook white rice, but some have time settings and some not, then one example command would be "Cook white rice. Suggested timing is 30 minutes". In this case, the simpler appliance just need to choose the "white rice" feature, and the more advanced machine can additionally set the time to 30 minutes. 

Another example of setting commands applicable to all appliances would be to set a target variable to maximum value. For example, suppose an air purifier has a wind speed range of "small", "medium", "large", and another appliance has a range from 1 to 5. Then a command of "setting wind speed to minimum" still allows both appliance to have one specific target value, which is "small" and "1".

Things that are generally true can be proposed as much as possible, such as food type, power level, wind speed, water level, but do not mention menu or program that are specific to a particular machine. Instead, you can use free form langauge to describe the target menu or program you are looking for. 

Please give 10 different everyday commands. 

The user manual of the appliances are listed below in sequence. Please take into consideration the ability of all appliance instances.
