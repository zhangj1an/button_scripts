format the input file below by removing redundant explanation text or commenting them out, and save it to a python file to make the file directly executable using a exec() function. Remove example usages, make sure nothing is initiated when I execute the file.

for each input file, add the following line in the header so that some functions can be directly called:

import sys 
sys.path.append("/data/home/jian/RLS_microwave/utils")
from _5_build_world_model._0_logic_units import DiscreteVariable, ContinuousVariable, Appliance, Mode, TimeVariable, Variable, VariableTimeInputString, PiecewiseTimeVariable

Double check the Python code syntax is right, for example, the method name should be connected with "_", and not "-". 

The appliance class should always start with:

class Simulator(Appliance)

the name should be Simulator, and not anything else. 

The input file is as follows:
